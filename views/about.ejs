                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>The Weedagama Foundation was established with a simple yet powerful mission: to support the often overlooked and underserved schools having grades k-5 with less than 100 students, regardless of ethnic, religious, and racial backgrounds in rural Sri Lanka.</p>
                
                <p>Our conviction is that fundamental educational resources should be universal - every child deserves quality instruction, technological access, proper nutrition, and secure, hygienic learning spaces. We concentrate on developing enduring, self-sustaining initiatives that enable communities to flourish with growing independence.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We collaborate directly with schools and communities to understand their most critical challenges. Instead of prescribing predetermined solutions, we prioritize listening to community voices to understand their genuine priorities, then deliver focused assistance that generates sustainable results. Our approach centers on partnering exclusively with school administrative leadership, ensuring active engagement in all programs and activities while maintaining compliance with rigorous guidelines and reporting standards established through mutual agreement at program initiation, with flexibility for modifications as circumstances evolve. All participating schools must maintain full compliance with regulations set forth by the Sri Lankan government and its relevant educational departments and jurisdictions.</p>
                
                <h3>Global Reach, Local Impact</h3>
                <p>We maintain a special focus on rural areas in Sri Lanka, where we help provide school supplies, improve access to technology, and support students with basic necessities.</p>
                <p>We launched the foundation in 2023 with a single school serving as our pilot program, and we are now planning strategic expansion to include additional educational institutions. Our growth trajectory aims to incorporate one new school in 2025, followed by two additional schools in 2026.</p>
