                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>The Weedagama Foundation was established with a simple yet powerful mission: to support the needy and underprivileged regardless of ethnic, religious, and racial backgrounds in local communities and internationally.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that every person deserves access to basic necessities - quality education, healthcare, nutritious food, and safe housing. Our foundation focuses on creating sustainable, long-term solutions that empower communities to thrive independently.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We work directly with schools, healthcare facilities, and communities to identify their most pressing needs. Rather than imposing solutions, we listen to what communities tell us they need most and provide targeted support that creates lasting impact.</p>
                
                <h3>Global Reach, Local Impact</h3>
                <p>While we support communities both locally and internationally, we maintain a special focus on rural areas in Sri Lanka, where we help provide school supplies to children, improve medical facilities, and support families with basic necessities.</p>
