                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>The Weedagama Foundation was established with a simple yet powerful mission: to support the needy and underprivileged with grades k-5 shools with less than 100 students, regardless of ethnic, religious, and racial backgrounds in local communities and internationally.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that every student deserves access to basic necessities - quality education, access to technology, nutritious food, and safe and clean learning environment. Our foundation focuses on creating sustainable, long-term solutions that empower communities to thrive independently.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We work directly with schools and communities to identify their most pressing needs. Rather than imposing solutions, we listen to what communities tell us they need most and provide targeted support that creates lasting impact. We solely rely on school's administration leads and actively participate in the programs/activities and adhere to the strict guidelines and reporting requirements that will be mutually agreed at the start as well any amendments to that as things progress. Schools are required to follow and adhere to the rules and regulations established by the Sri Lankan government and relevant departments and jurisdictions.</p>
                
                <h3>Global Reach, Local Impact</h3>
                <p>We maintain a special focus on rural areas in Sri Lanka, where we help provide school supplies, improve access to technology, and support students with basic necessities.</p>
                <p>in 2023 we strated the foundation with one school as a pilot and we are now looking to systematically expand add additional schools. Our tartget is to add one school in 2025 and another two in 2026.</p>
