                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>The Weedagama Foundation was established with a simple yet powerful mission: to support the often overlooked and underserved rural schools in Sri Lanka — specifically those serving fewer than 100 students in grades K–5 — regardless of ethnic, religious, or racial background.</p>
                
                <p>Our conviction is that fundamental educational resources should be universal. Every child deserves quality instruction, access to technology, proper nutrition, and safe, hygienic learning spaces. We focus on building enduring, self-sustaining initiatives that empower communities to grow with increasing independence.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We collaborate directly with schools and communities to understand their most pressing challenges. Rather than arriving with predetermined solutions, we listen first — learning what communities truly need — then deliver targeted support that drives lasting results.</p>
                <p>Our model is built on partnering exclusively with school leadership, ensuring active engagement across all programs while upholding rigorous guidelines and reporting standards established by mutual agreement at the outset, with the flexibility to adapt as circumstances evolve. All participating schools must remain in full compliance with regulations set forth by the Sri Lankan government and its relevant educational authorities.</p>
                
                <h3>Global Reach, Local Impact</h3>
                <p>Our focus is firmly rooted in rural Sri Lanka, where we help provide essential school supplies, expand access to technology, and support students with basic necessities.</p>
                <p>We launched the Foundation in 2023 with a single pilot school, and we are now planning a deliberate, strategic expansion. Our growth trajectory aims to welcome one new school in 2025, followed by two additional institutions in 2026 — each carefully selected to ensure our model continues to deliver meaningful, measurable impact.</p>
